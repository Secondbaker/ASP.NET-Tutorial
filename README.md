# ASP.NET-Tutorial
I'm using this repository to follow a tutorial for ASP.NET MVC for two reasons:
1. If things go wrong I can go back to the previous step
2. I have to explain how things work when I commit changes

This is the tutorial:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio

And I will be following along using Visual Studio Code.
